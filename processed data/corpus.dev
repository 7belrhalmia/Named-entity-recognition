Before  O

,  O
it  O
is  O
important  O
to  O
note  O
the  O
following  O
:  O
 
EXCERPT  O
:  O
Patients  O
should  O
not  O
use  O
STENDRA  O
if  O
sexual  O
activity  O
is  O
inadvisable  O
due  O
to  O
cardiovascular  O
status  O
or  O
any  O
other  O
reason  O
(  O

)  O
 
Use  O
of  O
STENDRA  O
with  O
alpha  O

blockers  O
,  O
other  O
antihypertensives  O
,  O
or  O
substantial  O
amounts  O
of  O
alcohol  O
(  O
greater  O
than  O
3  O

)  O
may  O
lead  O
to  O
hypotension  B-AdverseReaction
(  O
2.3  O
,  O
5.6  O
,  O
5.7  O
)  O
 
Patients  O
should  O
seek  O
emergency  O
treatment  O
if  O
an  O
erection  O
lasts  O
greater  O
than  O
4  O
hours  O
(  O
5.3  O
)  O
 
Patients  O
should  O
stop  O
STENDRA  O
and  O
seek  O
medical  O
care  O
if  O
a  O
sudden  O
loss  O
of  O
vision  O
occurs  O
in  O
one  O
or  O
both  O

of  O
Non  O
Arteritic  O

Neuropathy  O
(  O

)  O
.  O
 
STENDRA  O
should  O
be  O
used  O
with  O
caution  O
,  O
and  O
only  O
when  O
the  O
anticipated  O
benefits  O
outweigh  O
the  O
risks  O
,  O
in  O
patients  O
with  O
a  O
history  O
of  O
NAION  O
.  O
 
Patients  O

at  O
an  O
increased  O
risk  O
of  O
NAION  O
(  O
5.4  O
,  O
6.2  O
)  O
 
Patients  O
should  O
stop  O
taking  O
STENDRA  O
and  O
seek  O
prompt  O
medical  O
attention  O
in  O
the  O
event  O
