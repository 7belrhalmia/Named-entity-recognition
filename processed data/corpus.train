PRECAUTIONS  O
 
5.1  O
Hyperammonemia  O
 
Any  O
episode  O
of  O
acute  O
symptomatic  O
hyperammonemia  O
should  O
be  O
treated  O
as  O
a  O
life  O
-  O
threatening  O
emergency  O
.  O
 
Treatment  O
of  O
hyperammonemia  O
may  O
require  O
dialysis  O
,  O
preferably  O
hemodialysis  O
,  O
to  O
remove  O
a  O
large  O
burden  O
of  O
ammonia  O
.  O
 
Uncontrolled  O
hyperammonemia  O
can  O
rapidly  O
result  O
in  O

.  O
 
Management  O
of  O
hyperammonemia  O
due  O
to  O

should  O
be  O
done  O
in  O
coordination  O
with  O

The  O
diagnostic  O
evaluation  O
of  O
patients  O

is  O
complicated  O
.  O
 
In  O
arriving  O
at  O
a  O
diagnosis  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
important  O
to  O
identify  O
cases  O
in  O
which  O
the  O

presentation  O
includes  O
both  O
serious  O
medical  O
illness  O

The  O
management  O
of  O
this  O

should  O
include  O
:  O
(  O
1  O
)  O
immediate  O
discontinuation  O
of  O
the  O
antipsychotic  O
drugs  O
and  O
other  O

not  O
essential  O
to  O

therapy  O

of  O
any  O

There  O
is  O
no  O

agreement  O
about  O

regimens  O
for  O

If  O
a  O

treatment  O
after  O
recovery  O
from  O
NMS  O
,  O
the  O
potential  O
reintroduction  O
of  O
drug  O
therapy  O
should  O
be  O
carefully  O
considered  O
.  O
 
The  O
patient  O
should  O

,  O
since  O

Tardive  O
Dyskinesia  O
 
Tardive  B-AdverseReaction
dyskinesia  I-AdverseReaction
is  O
a  O
syndrome  O
consisting  O
of  O
potentially  O
irreversible  O
,  O
involuntary  B-AdverseReaction
,  I-AdverseReaction
dyskinetic  I-AdverseReaction
movements  I-AdverseReaction
,  O
which  O
may  O
develop  O
in  O
patients  O
treated  O
with  O
antipsychotic  B-DrugClass
drugs  I-DrugClass
.  O
 
Although  O
the  O
prevalence  O
of  O
the  O
syndrome  O
appears  O
to  O
be  O
highest  O
among  O
the  O
elderly  O
,  O
especially  O
elderly  O
women  O
,  O
it  O
is  O
impossible  O
to  O
rely  O
on  O
prevalence  O
estimates  O
to  O
predict  O
,  O
at  O
the  O
inception  O
of  O
antipsychotic  O
treatment  O
,  O
which  O
patients  O
are  O
likely  O
to  O
develop  O
the  O
syndrome  O
.  O
 
Whether  O
antipsychotic  O
drug  O
products  O
differ  O
in  O
their  O
potential  O
to  O
cause  O
tardive  O
dyskinesia  O
is  O
unknown  O
.  O
 
The  O
risk  O
of  O
developing  O
tardive  O
dyskinesia  O
and  O
the  O
likelihood  O
that  O
it  O
will  O
become  O
irreversible  O
are  O
believed  O
to  O
increase  O
as  O
the  O
duration  O
of  O
treatment  O
and  O
the  O
total  O
cumulative  O
dose  O
of  O
antipsychotic  O
administered  O
increases  O
.  O
 
However  O
,  O
the  O
syndrome  O
can  O
develop  O
,  O
although  O
much  O
less  O
commonly  O
,  O
after  O
relatively  O
brief  O
treatment  O
periods  O
at  O
low  O
doses  O
.  O
 
There  O
is  O
no  O
known  O
treatment  O
for  O
established  O
cases  O
of  O
tardive  O
dyskinesia  O
,  O
although  O
the  O
syndrome  O
may  O
remit  O
,  O
partially  O
or  O
completely  O
,  O
if  O
antipsychotic  O
treatment  O
is  O
withdrawn  O
.  O
 
Antipsychotic  O
treatment  O
itself  O
,  O
however  O
,  O
may  O
suppress  O
(  O
or  O
partially  O
suppress  O
)  O
the  O
signs  O
and  O
symptoms  O
of  O
the  O
syndrome  O
and  O
thereby  O
may  O
possibly  O
mask  O
the  O
underlying  O
process  O
.  O
 
The  O
effect  O
that  O
symptomatic  O
suppression  O
has  O
upon  O
the  O
long  O
-  O
term  O
course  O
of  O
the  O
syndrome  O
is  O
unknown  O
.  O
 
Given  O
these  O
considerations  O
,  O
FANAPT  O
should  O
be  O
prescribed  O
in  O
a  O
manner  O
that  O
is  O
most  O
likely  O
to  O
minimize  O
the  O
occurrence  O
of  O
tardive  O
dyskinesia  O
.  O
 
Chronic  O
antipsychotic  O
treatment  O
should  O
generally  O
be  O
reserved  O
for  O
patients  O
who  O
suffer  O
from  O
a  O
chronic  O
illness  O
that  O
(  O

)  O
is  O
known  O
to  O
respond  O
to  O
antipsychotic  O
drugs  O
,  O
and  O
(  O

)  O
for  O
whom  O
alternative  O
,  O
equally  O
effective  O
,  O
but  O
potentially  O
less  O
harmful  O
treatments  O
are  O
not  O
available  O
or  O
appropriate  O
.  O
 
In  O
patients  O
who  O
do  O
require  O
chronic  O
treatment  O
,  O
the  O

dose  O
and  O
the  O
shortest  O
duration  O
of  O
treatment  O
producing  O
a  O
satisfactory  O
clinical  O
response  O
should  O
be  O
sought  O
.  O
 
The  O
need  O
for  O
continued  O
treatment  O
should  O
be  O
reassessed  O
periodically  O
.  O
 
If  O

in  O
a  O
